A total of 1104 respondents aged 18 years and over, were recruited by telephone between November 20 and 28, 2015, to investigate fear, risk perception, and psychological distress during the dengue outbreak. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that fear of dengue was more prevalent in the areas that were most affected, as well as those with infected friends or relatives. Fear was also more pronounced among females and the elderly group, especially in terms of perceived risk of infection, severity of the infection, the uncertain cured rate, the adverse effects on daily life, which all lead to psychological distress. Fear of dengue fever, perceived risk of dengue infection, and psychological distress associated with the dengue fever pandemic are the main variables investigated in this study. Since media mass can serve as a unified platform for all public health communications, it is recommended that the government utilizes the power of media to deliver pandemic prevention measures. Specifically, health education interventions related to risk communication should focus on the most infected areas while taking gender and age into consideration.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Shih</LastName><ForeName>Fuh-Yuan</ForeName><Initials>FY</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Emergency Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lyu</LastName><ForeName>Shu-Yu</ForeName><Initials>SY</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0001-6027-2487</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Leisure Industry and Health Promotion, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Yang</LastName><ForeName>Chih-Chien</ForeName><Initials>CC</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Graduate Institute of Educational Information and Measurement, National Taichung University of Education, Taichung, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Chang</LastName><ForeName>Yao-Tsung</ForeName><Initials>YT</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Public Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Lin</LastName><ForeName>Ching-Feng</ForeName><Initials>CF</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Taipei Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Health Care Management, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>School of Health Care Administration, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Morisky</LastName><ForeName>Donald E</ForeName><Initials>DE</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Department of Community Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2023</Year><Month>09</Month><Day>20</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>China</Country><MedlineTA>Asia Pac J Public Health</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>8708538</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>1010-5395</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">dengue fever</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">health education</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">psychological distress</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">public fear</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">risk perception</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>20</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>20</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2023</Year><Month>9</Month><Day>20</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>23</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">37727955</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1177/10105395231198939</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
